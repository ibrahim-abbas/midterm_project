# midterm_project

### Overview
For this midterm project, we explored the relationship between carbon levels (CO2) and 
global temperatures across time. We focused on 63 regions with over 90 countries within 
the span of 1990-2013.

### Data Sources:
We used two data sources that comprised of six files from:
- Kaggle Data Set (Berkeley Earth) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
- OECD Data Set - https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AIR_GHG

### ETL Process:
We first cleaned the different files involved including:
 - Transposing the OECD data set.
 - Filtering out only countries in the Kaggle Berkeley Earth Data set to only include those
 in the OECD data set.
